Python Markdown Content Manager.

This is a desktop wiki to manage notes and files,
inspired by [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).

The content is written in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Each page of markdown text is stored in separate files in the `data/pages/` directory.

Non-markdown files can be "uploaded" and stored in the `media/` directory structure.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.
