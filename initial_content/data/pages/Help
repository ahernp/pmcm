# Help

This desktop wiki was inspired by [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) classic
([sample](https://ahernp.com/media/download/tw.html)).

This is a Python application which runs a web server for local use only. A firewall should be used to prevent remote access to this server.

Its content consists of:

* Markdown pages (stored in the `data/pages` directory).
* Uploaded pages (stored under the `media` directory).

These should be backed up regularly.

## Usage

### Navigation

The topmost menu on the left is controlled by the [Main Menu](/pages/main-menu) page. This should contain the most frequently used pages.

That menu also contains links to a [Sitemap](/sitemap) listing all of the pages in the wiki as well as [Uploads](/uploads) which lists all files "uploaded" to the wiki (such as images, documents and code).

Click on the ToC button to toggle the display of a Table of Contents for the current page. Each header in the page is linked to in the ToC.

On the right of the page is a search field. Entering text and pressing enter searches through the pages.

Below that is a list of links to the most recently visited pages.

Links beginning with `/` (except those beginning `/media/`) are rendered without underlines. This makes it easier to see external links.

### Editing

Edit pages by clicking on "Edit" in the menu on the left.

Create new pages by adding a link to an existing page with a relative url in the form `[]New Page](/pages/new page` (e.g. [New Page](/pages/New Page)).
